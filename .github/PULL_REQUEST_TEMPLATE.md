### ‚ùó IMPORTANT: Automatic Release Check
*These checks guide the TBD process.*

**1. Type of Change (for the Merge Commit Title)**
Which Conventional Commit prefix best describes this change?
**This prefix MUST be used in the "Squash and Merge" commit title.**

- [ ] `feat:` (A new feature for the user)
- [ ] `fix:` (A bug fix for the user)
- [ ] `docs:` (Documentation update)
- [ ] `chore:` (Maintenance, CI, configuration, dependencies)
- [ ] `refactor:` (Code refactoring without functional changes)
- [ ] `test:` (Adding or modifying tests)
- [ ] `style:` (Code formatting)

*(Remember: only `feat:` and `fix:` will trigger a new release)*

**2. Feature Flag Check (for Trunk Based Development)**
If you are adding a `feat:`, how is it managed?

- [ ] This is not a feature (it's a `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.)
- [ ] It's a complete feature and ready to be released to users.
- [ ] It's an incomplete or in-test feature, and it is **hidden behind a Feature Flag**.

**3. Breaking Change**
Does this modification introduce a *Breaking Change*?

- [ ] No
- [ ] **Yes**
<!--- 
      If YES: 
      1. The merge commit title MUST contain `feat!: ...` or `fix!: ...`
      2. You MUST add a description of the breaking change in the commit footer,
         starting with `BREAKING CHANGE: [description]`
